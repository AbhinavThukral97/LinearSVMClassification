# Forest Cover Type Detection - Linear SVM Classification
Implementation of forest cover type classification/detection using linear support vector machine implemented with gradient descent from scratch.

### Intuition behind SVM cost function

The sigmoid function used for logistic regression has the following curve:

The classification of the hypothesis is considered 1 if sigmoid(z)>=0.5 and 0 if it is <0.5

The cost for such classification without margins is hence:

_(Cost without regularisation)_

In this case, we want z (= Theta transpose * X) > 0 for y = 1 and z < 0 for y = 0

**__Changing the cost functions__**

Now, if instead of using the logarithmic terms to increase cost for incorrect predictions, we use the following cost0 and cost1 functions, our final cost function looks like:

It can be inferred that the cost is zero when z>=1 for y=1 and increases linearly for z<1.
Similarly, the cost is zero when z<=-1 for y=0 and increases linearly for z>-1.

If this new cost function is minimized, it ensures that z > 1 for y = 1 and z < -1 for y = 0, as opposed to the previous case. Hence, it adds a margin of 1 to our predictions, resulting in a better decision boundary/hyperplane.

Maximising margins is the main intuition behind the functioning of support vector machines.
